# Starter SASS template

A starter template for building websites using SASS and npm build process.

## What is this?

This is an empty template based on a 7-1 SASS arhitecture pattern which contains all of the necessary tools to start a simple web project with HTML and SASS, including npm script to build, minify, and watch source files.

This template uses Stephanie's Eckles npm script [from her blog](https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/minimum-static-site-sass-setup/) and was inspired by Kevin Powell's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4cECvhrBo8).

## Usage

**Foremost, you need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed and then you can start the setup:**

Open the terminal within the project folder and run:
```bash
npm i
```
Then, you can run the command to build/watch a HTML and SASS files:

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The template will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
